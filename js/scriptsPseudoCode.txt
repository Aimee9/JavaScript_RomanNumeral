for every # <= 39999

//from get numerals function:
//declare "biggestLittle" to hold largest qualifying Roman numeral which is <= (number)
// getBiggestLittle(number), add to end of array called romanNums, which will hold roman numera'
//for loop which runs until number = 0..
    //number = number - biggestLittle
    //getBiggestLittle(number);
//end of for loop
//now we have the roman numerals, except if a 9 is involved

   var bigestLittle = (largest numeral that is <= number as many times as possible)

   for(loops for as long as secondBiggestLittler > 0){
      var secondBiggestLittle = (number - biggestLittle)
      biggestLitte = (largest numeral that is <= number)
  }




   then get second/third etc number largest <= subtracted numeral
