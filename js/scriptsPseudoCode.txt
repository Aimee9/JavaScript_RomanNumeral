for every # <= 39999

   var bigestLittle = (largest numeral that is <= number as many times as possible)

   for(loops for as long as secondBiggestLittler > 0){
      var secondBiggestLittle = (number - biggestLittle)
      biggestLitte = (largest numeral that is <= number)
  }




   then get second/third etc number largest <= subtracted numeral
